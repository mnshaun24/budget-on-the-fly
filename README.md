## Shaun's Budget-on-the-Fly (BotFly) App

## About
For BotFly, I created a back-end to attach to an existing front-end. I created models, subschema and subdocuments with Mongoose. I used virtuals to extend the models' functionality. And I incorporated IndexedDB to add offline functionality. The app is deployed on Heroku using MongoDB Atlas to host the database remotely.

## Purpose
To practice creating a back-end with a NoSQL database. To practice offline functionality to improve user experience.

## Built With
* Node
* Express
* NoSQL
* Heroku
* JavaScript
* Mongoose
* IndexedDB
